  <h3>Encoding</h3>
  <p>
    The red color encodes the number of fire department call for service that went
    to a given station. The depth is encoded by the Viridis color scale, but has
    no useful data other than the differentiate them from each other and from
    the the leaf node color scale. The circle placement encode a parent to child
    relationship by representing a "belongs to" relationship. The size also
    encodes the number of fire department call for service that went to a given
    station.

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    It is even easier to see here (versus the dendrogram) that Station Area 1
    has the highest count. We can also see that Division 2 and 3 have about the
    comparable counts while the Station Areas that fall outside of that range
    are much smaller.
